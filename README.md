# Docker Image to run multiple programs for a multi-agent robotic system (Experimental)

## Overview 

This repository provides a collection of programs designed to implement and operate state-of-the-art visual servoing techniques within an autonomous UAV, specifically the Qualcomm RB5 Drone. It also facilitates the deployment of a ROS Master on a Jetson NX Board, enabling robust communication and control across multiple agents in a robotic system. This project represents both a personal exploration and an academic research initiative.

## Docker Support

To ensure seamless deployment in any environment a Dockerfile was added to the repo to facilitate the process of running each program.

## Hardware and Tech Stack 

- Jetson NX Board
- Qualcomm RB5 Drone
- Turtlebot
